Coronavirus and its Impacts: Information Dashboard

Welcome to our Corona Dashboard! 

This project is our submission for the Brown 2020 Datathon. 
Our primary goals in creating this dashboard are:
* presenting a user-friendly data visualiation application to portfolio managers
* enable modularity and scalability 
* explore a variety of alternative data sources
* leverage interactive visualizations using Plotly 
  
There are 4 main subpages on this dashboard:
* Visa Type Decomposition (2019)
* Coronavirus Details
* Travel by Nationality
* Ports of Entry

== UPDATE 2/25/20 == 
The application has successfully been deployed using Heroku! 

Visit the dashboard at https://airline-outlook-2020.herokuapp.com/.

To launch the application locally, `cd` into the `proj` directory.
Then, type in `python index.py` and open the dashboard in your browser.
